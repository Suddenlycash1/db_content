= DB Content Plugin

The DB Content plugin for Rails adds tasks to save and restore
database content.  It currently works only with the Mysql adaptor, and
only on unix (e.g.  Linux and MacOS); see lib/connection_content for
how to add support for other databases.

  rake db:content:archive
    Saves a timestamped database to db/archive/#{timestamp}.sql.gz

  rake db:content:dump
    Dumps the database to FILE or db/#{RAILS_ENV}-content.sql.gz.  If
    FILE ends in .gz, the file is compressed.

  rake db:content:load
    Loads the database from FILE or db/#{RAILS_ENV}-content.sql.gz,
    and migrates it to the current schema version.  If FILE ends
    in.gz, the file is piped through gunzip.
