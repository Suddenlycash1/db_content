= DB_Content Plugin

The DB_Content plugin for Rails adds tasks to save and restore
database content.  It currently works only with the Mysql adaptor, and
only on unix (e.g.  Linux and MacOS); see lib/connection_content for
how to add support for other databases.

  rake db:content:archive
    Save a timestamped database to db/archive/#{timestamp}.sql.gz

  rake db:content:dump
    Dump the database to FILE or db/content.sql.gz

  rake db:content:load
    Load the database from FILE or db/content.sql.gz

The file is piped through zip or unzip if its name ends in '.gz'.
