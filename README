= DB Content Plugin

The DB Content plugin for Rails adds tasks to save and restore
database content.  It currently works only with the Mysql adaptor, and
only on unix (e.g.  Linux and MacOS); see lib/connection_content for
how to add support for other databases.

  rake db:content:archive
    Save a timestamped database to db/archive/#{timestamp}.sql.gz

  rake db:content:dump
    Dump the database to FILE or db/#{RAILS_ENV}_content.sql.gz

  rake db:content:load
    Load the database from FILE or db/#{RAILS_ENV}_content.sql.gz,
    and migrate it to the current schema version.

The file is piped through zip or unzip if its name ends in '.gz'.
